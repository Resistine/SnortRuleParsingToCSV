# SnortRules
Just a Python script to download public Snort rules, pick a few fields and push them into .csv file.

The second step is to assign them with MITRE ATT&CK using https://attack.mitre.org/resources/attack-data-and-tools/ and some human effort, eventually some AI ;-)


### Dependencies

> pip install mitreattack-python

> git clone https://github.com/g-rd/snortparser.git

### Run

> python3 parse_snort_rules.py

Please be patient, the first run may take a couple of minutes.

It downloads the latest MITRE ATT&CK matrix and creates the Excel files \
(delete the *enterprise-attack* directory to update it)

And the latest Snort Community Rules \
(delete the *snort3-community-rules* directory to update it)

### Check
The result will be in ***rules_parsed.csv*** file.

Note, this will fill in a few TActics and Techniques. \
If you don't know how to fill in the rest, rather get the annotated files from: \
